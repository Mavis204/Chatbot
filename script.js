They'll want to know the name of your junior high school, its address, and your student ID number if you have one. They might also ask about your academic achievements or any awards you received.\n*   **Contact Information:** Make sure to provide your active mobile number and email address, as the school will use these to contact you, especially for that important SMS confirmation!\n*   **Emergency Contact Information:**  This is for someone the school can contact in case of an emergency.  Usually, it's someone different from your parents/guardians.\n*   **Grade Level and Strand Preference:**  You'll need to indicate that you're applying for Senior High School (Grades 11 or 12) and choose your preferred academic strand.  Do you have a strand in mind yet? ICPS offers strands like **ABM, GAS, and STEM**.\n\n**Important Tip:**  When you're filling out the actual online form, please make sure to have these details ready and fill everything out **accurately and truthfully**.

These are designed to create a focused learning environment where students can thrive.\n\nHere's a balanced perspective:\n\n* **Structure and Order:** ICPS values a structured learning environment.  This means there are clear expectations for student behavior, dress code, and participation in school activities.  These rules create a sense of order and predictability, which can be helpful for many students.\n\n* **Emphasis on Values:** The school emphasizes values such as respect, responsibility, and academic integrity.  These values are integrated into the curriculum and school culture, creating a community where students are encouraged to grow not just academically, but also personally and spiritually.\n\n* **Focus on Faith:** As a Catholic school, ICPS incorporates faith-based activities and teachings into daily life.  This includes daily prayers, religious instruction, and participation in faith-related events.  This aspect of the school might be perceived as \"strict\" by those who don't share the same faith, but it is a core element of ICPS's identity.\n\n* **Disciplinary Approach:**  ICPS typically uses a balanced approach to discipline.  Verbal warnings are common for minor offenses.  More serious matters are usually handled through the Guidance Office, where the focus is on helping the student understand the consequences of their actions and learn from them.\n\nUltimately, whether ICPS is considered \"strict\" depends on individual perspectives.  The rules and guidelines aim to foster a positive and focused learning environment, but they are also designed to promote personal growth and responsibility.\n\nIs there a particular area of school life you are wondering about regarding the school's guidelines? I can provide more details if you have a specific question in mind! 😊\n\n"},
